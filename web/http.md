# Request methods

## overview

    HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource.

### `GET`

  Requests using GET should only retrieve data.

### `HEAD`

  Ask for a response identical to that of a `GET` request, _but without the response body_.

### `POST`

  _**Submit**_ an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.

### `PUT`

  _**Replace**_ all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
