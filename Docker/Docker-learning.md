## image build

The `docker build` command builds an image from a `Dockerfile` and a `context`.  

The buildâ€™s context is the set of files at a specified location `PATH` or `URL`. The `PATH` is a directory on your local filesystem. The `URL` is a Git repository location.

Traditionally, the `Dockerfile` is called `Dockerfile` and located in the root of the context. You use the `-f` flag with `docker build` to point to a Dockerfile anywhere in your file system.

```
$ docker build -f /path/to/a/Dockerfile .  
$ docker build -f dockerfilepath contextpath
```
